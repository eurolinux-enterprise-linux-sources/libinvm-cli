#libinvm-cli

libinvm-cli is a framework library supporting common
storage command line interface (CLI) applications. 

GNU Make is used to build for Linux and Windows.
As such we recommend mingw_w64 and msys be used to build in a windows
environment. Both of which can be found at mingw.org

#Build Windows

Windows build has an external dependency on libinvm-i18n Library headers and binaries.
https://01.org/intel-nvm-i18n-library

The expected location of these dependencies is external/intel_i18n/include and external/intel_i18n/windows_release
